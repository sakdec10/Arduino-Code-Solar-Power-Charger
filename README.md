# Arduino-Code-Solar-Power-Charger

The arduino code for solar power charger embedded system. THe code is in C++ using Arduino Library. 

The solar power charger was an idea where people can take this charger to any place and charge their devices. They dont need to be near any charge socket with this solar power charger at their hand. Its really for the people that want to go out for adventures in wilderness and dont want their devices to switch off.

This was also thought of like a solar power charging station where we can people enter password given to them and use this charging station. This prevents any else using the station espicially during the night time when there is limited energy.

And for the poeple concerned with their carbon footprints the display shows how much have they saved in terms on their carbon footprints.

These are some of the pictures I of my finished project
